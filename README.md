# Starting Unity! ðŸŽ® ðŸ“· ðŸ“± #

I've built a collection of Unity projects within the Atlas School Program.
This includes the introduction of C# and some AR aspects.

**One of my favorite portions of this repo is the AR folder!**

Using a database to collect info on images being shown to the camera, it's able to play the animation and allow buttons to be clicked on.
(Buttons lead to my socials. You can find more through the Assets folder of the project!)

**The other portion of repo is a platformer that I've created from scratch!**

I used assets given by the school, and created my designs for a platformer!
Including sound, animation, level design, UIs, etc.
